### Starting Again, Again, ...
When I created 5280code.com I was looking for a public playground for coding &
blogging. I wanted to be more active in the online community. BUT life got busy
and then I realize I haven't blogged in over 18 months. In that 18 months,
I've joined a new start up, married the love of my life, and have prepared
myself to start a family. So life is good!

Blinker is the company I joined, we help provide consumers a more transparent
way for transacting on a used car. A used car transaction can be really shady
when it comes to Craigslist, dealers, and scammers. I feel
[Blinker](http://blinker.com) can really change the way consumers feel about
purchasing a used car. Instead of a deep cringe, hopefully we can make it just
as painless as Airbnb has made renting a complete stranger's home.

### So why Elixir?
Back when Elixir was pre-1.0, I was always intrigued to see what it would
become and how the community would grow or fail.  It not only grew but exploded
in the past years. Many developers are pivoting from a number of languages and
diving head first into Elixir-land. Even respected companies like Thoughtbot
have even become [evangelists for the language](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-replaced-react-with-phoenix).

I never really dipped more than a toe into reading and learning, until I joined
Blinker. I work with a couple co-workers that see the same bright future for
Elixir. That was really encouraged me to learn some of the ins and outs of the
language.  I started with a few
[exercism.io exercises](https://github.com/codebender/exercism). Then I read
through most of [The Pragmatic Programmers _Programming Elixir_](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) book. The more
I've learn, the more I enjoy writing Elixir.

### Burn it all with fire!
In the spirit of continuing my elixir learning, I'm rewriting the 5280code.com
website in Elixir & Phoenix. This is the first Blog Post that will appear on the
new stack. I'll start with the blog functionality and expand once again from
there. Wish me luck! Here is the new repo for the site: https://github.com/codebender/phoenix5280
