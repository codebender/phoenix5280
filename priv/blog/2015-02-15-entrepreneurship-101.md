### I do what I want!
Most of us want to be our own bosses eventually, right? But how does one become
an entrepreneur, especially as an engineer? Well you could start taking night
classes for a MBA or even look for a college that offers entrepreneurship
classes for engineers.

### Deal of a lifetime
So I was trolling the internets and stumbled across an unbelievable deal. I
would do just about anything for **$1000 AWS credit**, walk across hot coals,
jump into a freezing cold lake, or skydive. Wait, all I have to do is take a
entrepreneurship class??? Is this real life??? [Get $1000 of Amazon Web Services
free when you earn a verified certificate in Entrepreneurship 101 or
Entrepreneurship 102](https://www.edx.org/AWS-activate) *note: the "verified
certificate" costs $50, but you can take the course for free*

### MITx: 15.390.1x Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer?
I enrolled in [Entrepreneurship 101](
https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x)
and it is going great.  MITx does an incredible job.  They provide a series of
short videos and bring in past MIT alumni with real life examples of the course
concepts. Enroll today if you want to get the process started in becoming your
own boss or if you want to fund your side projects or BOTH. I do plan on
enrolling in [Entrepreneurship 102](
https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-102-what-can-you-do-mitx-15-390-2x)
after I complete 101.
